# Word Aligner Algorithm from Sultan et. al(2014)

### Implemented using NLTK and SPACY Libraries

#### To execute the word aligner using NLTK and Spacy 
  - Run ```python example_align.py nltk ``` to use the word aligner using **NLTK** 
  - Run ```python example_align.py spacy ``` to use the word aligner using **Spacy** 
  - In order to modify the sentences, user needs to modify ```example_align.py```
  - Make sure to download stanford packages and change directories in ```nltkUtil.py``` and set environment variable for ```stanford NER and POS tagger```
  
### Dependencies
  ```
  NLTK with its all packages
  Spacy
  Download Stanford packages for named entity recognition, part of speech tagger, and parsers(we use few stanford packages to perform word aligning in NLTK)
  ```
